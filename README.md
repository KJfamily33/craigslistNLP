This project is for MGMT 590-Analyzing unstructured data at Krannert School of Management, developed by Team : Arun Ramakrishnan, Pranay Khandelwal, Roli Gupta, Shreeansh Priyadarshi and Samir Husain. This is a model to predict virality of a craigslist post and also filter NSFW content.

Introduction

Craigslist makes money through only a few revenue streams. Most of the postings are free and there are only few avenues where they charge to post a job listing or apartment listing. This is true for only a few major cities. However, Craigslist’s aim is to provide the simplest functionality in the service of society.

•	Situation and Complication- In order to help boost number of users and visit time, we propose to use the existing ‘Featured Listings’ section. In the current situation any listing gets into featured section based on the user likes. We propose to use this list of posts as a proxy for viral posts and predict the virality of a new post.
•	Solution- We plan to use machine learnings algorithm to classify posts as viral/not viral. This will help to increase customer time on site and bring in new customers. We also plan to create a separate section for Obscene posts which might hurt the user satisfaction for a few users.
•	Impact- This functionality would make it easier for website users to identify interesting and amusing posts. This move will potentially bring new users as people share posts with their friends. 

Project objective 

We first define success metrics for the Craigslist website. Since, they do not show display ads, the only source of revenue for Craigslist are the charge they levy on Job and real estate listing posting in some area. Hence, we define the success metrics in terms of Pageviews. For craigslist to increase its reach, they would want to increase the number of people who visit their website and the time these users spend on the website. The two motives are

1.	Increase traffic
2.	Increase time on site

We propose adding a ‘This is cool’ button on craigslist page. When users click on this button, they will be taken to a page which contains post that are similar in characteristics to the posts found on the Best of Craigslist page. We hope that this section will keep users on the website for longer browsing through interesting posts, they are also more likely to share some of these websites with their friends and get new users to the website. This would help us achieve both of our defined motives.
Craigslist is a website that while being the go-to classifieds site for most Americans, has also become home to a variety of funny, joke posts. We wish to work on this previously undocumented part of the website and explore ways to generate business value from the posts that people might find funny or interesting.
